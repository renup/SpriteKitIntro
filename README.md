SpriteKitIntro
==============

This project is meant to give you an introduction to sprite kit. Using sprite kit you can achieve animations just like you'd do something similar to coco's 2d framework but with less complex code and easy to use framework.

In this project, I want to help you with integrating SpriteKit into your existing UIKit applications (eg: single view application, master detail application and so on).
